# UFOs
## Project Overview
#### The purpose of the project was to build a dynamic webpage showcasing UFO data from all over the world. Initially, visitors were welcome to scour our data by inputting a date. We then further expanded available user input through the inclusion of filtering on UFO data by city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
## The initial page.

### Summary
Removing the button and implementing dynamic filtering looks cleaner and results more quickly. However, a dynamic filter with several search criterias can get messy. Using a drop down menu for selection would probably make inquieries more user friendly.

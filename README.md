# UFOs
## Project Overview
#### The purpose of the project was to build a dynamic webpage showcasing UFO data from all over the world. Initially, visitors were welcome to scour our data by inputting a date. We then further expanded available user input through the inclusion of filtering on UFO data by city, state, country, and shape.
